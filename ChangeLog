mochad-0.1.14

    * Fix OpenRemote too many open sockets problem. This result in delayed
    responses to button presses.
    * Add extended_code_1 command. This can be used to send shutter/blinds
    control commands.

mochad-0.1.13

    * Fix -d debug command line option.

    * The SP554A motion sensor with the switch in the home/away position is
    now correctly decoded.

    * Add exit to potential infinite loops.

    * Add message for DS12A with cover off (tamper). The DS12A looks like
    two DS10As with the cover on.


mochad-0.1.12

    * Add --raw-data option from Marc Merlin. Programs such as MisterHouse
    can decode the raw RF data.

mochad-0.1.11

    * Fix xdim (extended dim) that only worked for unit code 3.

mochad-0.1.10

    * Fix major client socket problem. Commands from clients stopped working.

mochad-0.1.9

    * Add commands getstatus and getstatussec.
    getstatus <HU>          -- Get device HU on/off status
    getstatus <HU> xdim     -- Get device xdim status
    getstatusec <RFSECAddr> -- Get RF security device status such as DS10A.

    * Add port 1101 for OpenRemote 2.0. This is similar to port 1099 but does
    not include unsolicited event messages. OR polls for device events using
    getstatus and getstatussec.

mochad-0.1.8

    * Add support for X10 KR15A Big Red Button.
    * Allow '\r' as well as '\n' for line termination
    * Add more support for Flash XMLSocket clients including cross domain
    policy request and response for Chumby widgets. This is required to allow
    a Chumby widget to talk to mochad through an XMLSocket. Chumby widget
    should be released real soon now.
    * Add python-tk demo GUI application. Supports on and off buttons plus
    brighness slider using LM465 soft-start lamp modules. The slider will not
    work with older LM465 modules which lack soft-start. See apps/x10-tk.py.

mochad-0.1.7

    * Add Flash XMLSocket support on port 1100 for Chumby widgets.
    * Fix RF checksum problem when receiving from CM15A for house codes 9-16.

mochad-0.1.6

    * Add RF event filter to eliminate the flurry of duplicate events.
    This makes it much easier to write applications.
    * Skip extra leading 0x5D on received RF packets from CM15A.

mochad-0.1.5

    * Fix RFCAM command so it shows the transmit message.
    * Fix RF command which sent the wrong house in some cases. [ID: 3197002]

mochad-0.1.4

    * Fix RFCAM command so it takes house code as a parameter. For example,
    RFCAM C CAMUP sends a camera pan up command on house code C.
    Previously, RFCAM commands always used house code N. 

mochad-0.1.3

    * Change the method for sending dim/bright commands so it matches AHP
    The new method uses 3 bytes instead of 2. This seems to work better
    with LM465 soft-start devices. xdim works much better and is easier to use
    but does not work with all lamp modules.
    * Add example client programs in Perl and bash.
    * Add --version command line parameter.
    * Add support for SP554 motion sensor

mochad-0.1.2

    * Fix device name in log messages. CM19A was reported as CM15A.
    * Add install option that makes the controllers hot pluggable. udev in
    Ubunutu and hotplug2 in OpenWrt
    * Convert to use autoconf and automake.
    * Update mochad wiki pages with command and event reference. Also add
    instructions for building with OpenWrt.
